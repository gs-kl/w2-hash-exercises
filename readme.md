## Hashes are an important data structure in Ruby.
You will use them everyday as a Rails developer, and it is important to get
very comfortable with them.

## Getting Started

This project comes with a recommended Ruby version and a gemset. There is a Gemfile too.
There is no real code to write. We are just going to be modifying, reading and creating
hashes that live in our test world.

1. Fork this project to your github account
2. Clone it to your computer
3. cd into the project directory
4. `bundle` to get your dependencies in place
